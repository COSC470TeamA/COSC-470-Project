Broke down two main reason for s1: map and actor.

Map is tiles and doodads. Doodads are impassable tiles. 

Actor is abstract. Player is an actor. Actor and tile have position.
Actors may change position by gaining a vector from a mouse click.
Vector and therefore actor subject to pathfinding 

Map is an interface for phaser panel/container. 

Gamestate considered but irrelevant to immediate requirements.

Map generation must have no bubbles be an arbitrary size. Tiles arbitrary pixelsize.
Actor must be camera bound and respond in arbitrary small time frame 100ms

Style guide for game considered. Whiteboard art?
