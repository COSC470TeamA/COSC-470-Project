	Our mock project suffered mostly from the fact that our team did not take task generation seriously – and because of this, did not take to tackling tasks in a serious manner.
 We each added tasks, epics, and stories in an individual manner, and many of them were quite silly. Because of this - and because we did not curate the SBL – our sprint ended with a large chunk of work undone.
