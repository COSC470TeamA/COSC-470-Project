Our vision is to build an expense tracking application that uses receipt images to itemize transactions and categorize user’s spending habits. Actual spending habits can then be compared to desired budget and give the user an accurate representation of where they are over/under spending. The product will be available to the public, specifically targeting who desires to accurately keep track of their expenses, and distributed via Play Store and Apple App Store.

Some people have difficulty keeping track of where they are spending their money and may spend more than their budget allows in certain categories. By recording the costs of items from the user’s receipts, categorizing each item bought, and storing the data for later use, the user can easily keep track of their spending habits. Making the user aware of where they are spending their money allows them to adjust their spending. The application should also store the images of receipts (either cloud or on user’s device) to give them detailed records of transactions. 

Mint, Expensify, Foreceipt are a few of the systems currently in place that attempt to solve this problem. All these systems and products keep track of the user’s finances and expenses either through tracking their spending from their bank accounts/credit cards or photos of receipts. 

This product is different from these others as it breaks down items from one transaction into separate categories rather than placing entire transactions into categories. It also allows users to track their cash spending habits and transactions during which they made purchases in more than one category. It provides the photo recognition services locally instead of requiring a user to pay for processing photos on a server.
