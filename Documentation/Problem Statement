Steps of writing problem statements

(1)Describe the background context so that the problem (and solution) is easier to understand for the reader.  
If the background is clear (to all the targeted reader), you can jump right into the problem.
Start by describing how things (or should) work.  Maybe a brief description on WHAT this “THING” is.

Client has a vision for a game and requests a team from OKC to deliver. 
Acting Client: Chris Mazur

            upgradable items, bases, allies, enemies, maps...
            multiple tiers of advancement
            
  The serverside services should include:

            Network Matchmaking
            Integration with i.e. apple gamecenter, google play
            Clear communication logistics for reporting & suggestions


(2)Explain your problem:
It is Important that you can articulate the problem (being addressed) to the reader in a simple, 
clear, and straightforward fashion.
 
  The scope of the game is large; A-Team does not have a solid velocity and cannot yet provide an 
  educated guess as to how long it will take to implement all requested features with client approval.
  
  The features requested may have stylistic choices associated with them that have yet to be communicated or decided upon.
  Not all features may be necessary; more features may be added.
 

(3)Why is it a big deal?  Is the problem that you are discussing preventing your customer (user, system, process..etc) 
from moving forward (effectively), or making more money, or destroying the company, (costs ($$ or resource) ? )?

  If A-Team is unable to provide 
  
  The success or failure of the A-Team may determine their grading in certain college-level courses. Furthermore, the project itself
  may become significantly profitable if followed through to completion.

(4)Back up your assertions:
 Need to support your claims with data and evidence. Who else is having the same problem and what are they 
 do to address this problem

(5)Propose a solution and benefits
Should be clear and concise. Keep to the high level concept and leave the specification and implementation
details for later.  





(6)Conclusion and summary
Creating a High Concept can be surprisingly difficult. It should be as short and clear as possible. One way to make the process easier is to start by answering a set of questions that can help you focus on the core issues. The questions that follow may be helpful but, of course, they are general. If you have ideas about your specific problem, do not hesitate to add questions of your own. · 
List of questions that help to address the items above:
When does the problem occur? 
What assumptions are we making?   
Is this problem part of or reflective of a larger problem? 
Can this problem be broken into two or more smaller problems? 
How would others (be specific) look at this problem? 
What is happening that should not happen? 
What is not happening that should be? 
What is working well and is not a problem? 
What is the risk that we are facing?
