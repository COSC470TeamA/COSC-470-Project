//CATAGORIES (sould place this in seperate file)

-Total (double)
-SaleDate (date)
-DealerName (varchar)
-TrackerID (num)

//Tracker ID is a unique identifying number assigned to each entry in the table and can be used to keep track of receipts that do
//not provide a name to the retailer that provided them. It should increment by one with each new entry.

//SaleDate should take the date specified on the receipt and if it is not available then just input SYSDATE at the time the picture is
//taken

//Total is just the final total amount of money paid in the transaction, this should be a constant on any and all kinds of receipts
//though it doesn't make for a vey good primary key (see TrackerID).
